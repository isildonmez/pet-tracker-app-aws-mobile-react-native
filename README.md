## AWS Mobile React Native Starter App - Serverless Pet Tracker

Bootstrap a React Native application on AWS. This starter automatically provisions a Serverless infrastructure with authentication, authorization, image storage, API access and database operations. It also includes user registration and MFA support. The sample use case is a "Pet Tracker" where after a user registers and logs in they can upload pictures of their pet to the system along with information like the birthday or breed.
